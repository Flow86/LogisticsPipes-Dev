#LogisticsPipes

Logistics Pipes is an extensive overhaul of the Buildcraft pipe system. It allows for better distribution of items via pipes, more organised stockkeeping and easier automated crafting.

If you have any questions or other things to discuss, we will gladly welcome you in our channel #RS485 on irc.esper.net!

You are free to use this mod in your modpack, because its released under the MMPL.

Credits for the idea and basic code go to Krapht.
